				<br>		
				I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in Computer and Electronic Engineering in 1999. 
				I was one of the first persons in my family to obtain a degree but
				it was a long and somewhat twisted road. Throughout my early years at school 
				I often under achieved, spending more time messing about than studying. English 
				was by far my worse subject (as I'm sure you can tell!) but I excelled at Mathematics.
				In fact my proudest achievement in education was not graduating, it was getting 79% in my 
				final year (3 hour) math's exam with a severe lack of revision! 
				I have many memories of being told to stand in the corner by my teachers in primary school because 
				I wouldn't stop shouting the answers out! I also had quite a creative side and did 
				pretty well at art, woodwork, and even cookery!
				<p>
				I finished school with 8 GCSE's but the grades where not what I had hoped for. This was 
				probably due to the amount of time I had spent in the local pool hall in my final year at school. Snooker and pool
				had taken over my life and I gave up my education to become the first person in the UK to play snooker on 
				a government sponsored training scheme. However 1 year later I decided that I should at least finish my 
				education first so I gave up snooker to go back to college. I graduated from Grimsby College of Technology and Arts 
				in 1993 with a BTEC OND in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I then spent a brief year at Loughborough University 
				studying Physics before moving to Manchester where I completed my degree.
