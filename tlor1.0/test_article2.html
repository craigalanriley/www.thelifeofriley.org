<STRONG>All aboard!</STRONG><br>
Only 5 hours earlier I had (almost) finished packing my bags for a 3 month trip, I had only slept for a total of 30 hours in the last 6 days. My move out of my Nottingham apartment and the purchase and renovation of my new house had really taken its toll. I could hardly move a muscle and I would have eaten a chocolate cheese toasty for just 1 minute more sleep.None the less I leapt in the air, got dressed and ran down stairs with my bag, this was it...the 3 Month Caribbean and Americas World Championship Pool and Cricket Tour.</P>
<P>I had spent the last 18 months working for a web agency fixing more bugs than you could shake an apathetic stick it so I was well ready for the break. </P>


<STRONG>A slice of Pisa</STRONG><br>
<img src="http://www.thelifeofriley.org/uploads/images/small_DSC05118.JPG" align="right" alt="" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5">
I arrived in Pisa after an interesting flight, I had decided to fly from Doncaster to Pisa and then catch the train down to my pool tournament in Naples because of a Ryan air 1p special fair.
<P>Doncaster was close to my home town so bargain or so I thought! The price had already jumped to 20 quid due to taxes etc. but I wasn'tt expecting the 40 quid excess baggagecharge due to Ryan Airs not so special 15kg baggage allow<P>Security seemed a little tight for such an unspectacular route (unless old Osama was planning to take out the leaning tower with my 1p flight!). It was then I started to realize the reason I was outnumbered 7-1 by miserable looking Italian men was that they were all Roma supportersflying home after their Old Trafford Mauling! I got a little more worried when I noticed many of the faces looked pretty similar to the guys photographed during ugly scenes of violence in Manchester and splashed all over the sun which I was foolishly reading! </P>
<P>I arrived in Pisa after a bumpy but (thankfully) uneventful flight. I spent a couple of hours admiring the view and taking the usual cheesy innuendo laced snaps before heading back to the station for a long train ride down the coast to Naples or so I thought! </P>


<STRONG>Euro Tour - Naples</STRONG><br>
<img src="http://www.thelifeofriley.org/uploads/images/eurotour_italy.gif" align="right" alt="" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5">
About an hour outside Naples I realized that the tournament wasnt in Naples at all but some town outside it, this is where it all went wrong! To cut a long story short, 3trains, 2 strange dodgy towns, many texts, lots of bartering, a friendly hotel manager, 4 hours, and 50 Euros later I finally got to my room. Of course not only had my two room mates left me with the camp bed but I had also drawn an early morning match against the guy who finished 5<SUP>th</SUP> in the last event!
<P>
I got as much sleep as I could before playing terrible and losing my first match 10-2. Italy was the last event of the year and I need to make the semi finals to finish in the top 28 in the rankings and therefore qualify for the world championships in Manila in November. Losing my first match was not a great start; this put me on the losers side of the double elimination draw meaning I would need to win 6 more matches just to qualify for the last 32. </P>
<P>I sneaked through my next match 10-9 and won my next which gave me chance. I managed to get a good nights sleep and started out the next day much better. I beat 3 good players in a row (ending 1 guys dreams of the world championship spot. I was dead on my feet but the good news was I just needed to win one more match, the bad news was it was against a top German player ranked well above me and it was on the TV table. I started out ok but I quickly realized this wasnt going to be my day as lady luck seemed to be against me many times early on. </P>
<P>I went 8:5 down but battled hard to get back into a 9:8 lead. Unfortunately in the last frame I broke but didnt have a shot, I played a bad safety which resulted in 9-9 with my opponent breaking. He broke and ran down to the 7 ball which was tight on the cushion on the point of the middle pocket; he left himself a long shot past the 8 ball which was just off the cushion. He jumped up after the shot as he knew hed missed it, hed hit it very badly and it actually it the 8 ball before rattling in the jaws of the pocket. As I stood up to walk to the table I was shocked to see the 7 ball drop in and the whole crowd groaned in shock! </P>
<P>My Opponent, Christian Reimering went on to win the event, oh well that's the way the mop flops!&nbsp; </P>

God the sun was harsh; I had just spent the last few hours being hypnotized by the flames of the Peppermill bar drinking extra large cocktails. I had a mid day flight and of course the couple of drinks at the splash bar turned into an all night drinkathon! It was now 8am and the Vegas sun was just warming up, I felt like I could sleep for a week but I still had the travel day from hell ahead of me. I went back to my room and decided to pinch an hours sleep which wasnt the brightest idea in the world. Luckily my room mate saved me and I just made my flight to LA on time. 
<P></P>
<P>I arrived in LAX about 1pm and my connecting flight to Guatemala, at least I think that's where I was going wasnt until 11:45pm! genius! I dont like LA at the best of times never mind the airport, I managed to find some food after a tour of the airport with my $3.50 trolley. Of course the new all singing all dancing self check in machines advised me to come back at 5:45pm when I tried to get rid of my back pack, thanks Delta! I found a nice corner that was freshly cleaned by the not to happy cleaning lady, we had a bit of a wrestling match with the seats after shed done it but I just about muscled her out. I barricaded myself in wrapping myself around my bags and pricey trolley and pinched a few hours much needed sleep. </P>
<P>I was awoken by a shifty looking Asian guy who had gotten a bit too close for comfort, he had eyes on my patch and wasn't afraid to muscle in. I told him to piss off in no uncertain terms and he begrudgingly shuffled up a seat. It didn't really matter much as Id satisfied the self check machines rules and could dump my backpack anytime I chose. It's never that easy of course as lucky me not only got a new Delta recruit, but I also got to meet her jobs worth supervisor! Im sorry sir but we cant let you board your flight as you dont have a return ticket out of Guatemala, err what? I am leaving Guatemala overland via Belize (like 100,000 other travelers a year you imbecile I thought). Well Im sorry sir but the rules&amp;.bla bla bla. I dug my nails and heals into the counter, bit my tongue as much as I can until finally a Delta supervisor that didnt have a broom stuck up her ass let me board. Of course I breezed through customs in Guatemala without a second glance, get a grip Delta! </P>
<P>Now where the hell is Guatemala I thought as I boarded the plane with my $150 total cash in pocket? I settled into my seat and got my trusty Lonely Planet Central America guide out. Fortunately I was sat next to a cute American Guatemalan girl and her mother, or so I thought until she discovered a) I didnt know where the hell I was going and b) I didnt speak a word of Spanish! So why was I going to Guatemala anyway I hear you cry! Well I was planning on going to Cancun to save a bit of cash and practice for a month for the World Straight Pool Championships. A good plan I thought until the travel bug got hold of me and turned this perfectly good plan into a major journey. Belize is next to Cancun I could go there for a week, oh look Tikal is next to Belize I can go there too, oh look flights to Guatemala city are cheap I could fly there first and then go to Tikal! Well that was the plan, the problem was the more I read about Guatemala the more I wish I hadnt! Guns, rapes, murders, and kidnappings galore, and the capital (which I was heading for at 500mph) had the worse of it! </P>
<P>But wait whats this, a little town called Antigua only an hour outside the capital with direct shuttles from the airport. A world heritage site, popular base for backpackers, full of bars and a great place to buy onward discounted tickets to Tikal, magic! J I left the airport expecting the wild west as my white face exited the airport but it was surprisingly mellow, I wasnt harassed, manhandled or even raped once god damn it! I dont know you just cant get a good guide book these days. I saw a super nice guy with an Antigua shuttle sign, he carried my backpack to his van, charged me the going rate (ok guide book your forgiven), and let me sit in his van while he went and found another passenger! My co-passenger turned out to be a friendly informative American Guatemalan guy from LA. He gave me tons of tips and even donated his Guatemalan guide book for free (you better sort yourself out now Lonely Planet youve got competition!). </P>
<P>It was almost 6am when we pulled into Antigua and the tell tale cobble stone streets, I hadnt slept for more than a couple of hours in almost 3 days. However the sight of the Volcano that loomed over the town made it all worth while. The clouds where clear and this monster didnt just dwarf the town, it seemed to threaten its very existence! The town itself was just waking up, old men where going to work, women were setting up fruit stands, and young girls where rushing to school, I felt like Id stepped back in time. </P>
<P>I got the driver to drop me off in between a few hostels which hopefully had a spare room, even the nasty Volcano wasnt keeping my eyes open anymore I needed a bed, any bedand like NOW! Each hostel had a massive wooden door with a small hatch covered by metal poles. I knocked on the first one and a man opened the hatch suspiciously, this really must be a dangerous place I thought as I crossed the street, no rooms at the first. The next place had rooms but not for a couple of hours until somebody checked out butthey kindly let me into their fortress so I could sit down. Agh said the manager I do have a twin room but thats $14 instead of $9 for a single. I almost bit his hand off, even my backpack looked pleased. It's not often he gets his own bed, especially when its costing me an extra $5! Not only did I sleep all day, I slept all night too, about 16 hours straight, god was I tired! Even my backpack didn't make a sound but did I hell as get a thank you from him in the morning!</P>
<P>I couldn't wait to get out the room now, there's nothing better than the first day in a new country or town, its almost as good as a 1 night stand, well sometimes better infact (Maldives and big Tracey popped into my mind for a terrible second!). Not only that I had hardly eaten in 3 days and could eat a scabby dog! As I walked down the cobbledstreets to the main square I quickly realized I had over estimated my state of hunger as I passed several not so tidy dogs along the way. Nonetheless I was hungry and the reds cafe? was a welcome sight. Not only did it serve food which bested the scabby dog by a mile, it was the only place in town showing the England match in a couple of days - result!<BR>
