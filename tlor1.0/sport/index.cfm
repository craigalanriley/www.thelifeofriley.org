				Although childhood asthma prevented me from ever being a natural 
				athlete I absolutely loved sport when I was at school. I joined a judo club 
				when I was young and I also enjoyed swimming and certain 
				athletics such as field events and sprinting. I was also a very good climber 
				often risking life and limb hanging from branches at lofty heights!
				<p>
				However it was football and billiards which I truly loved. I played football 
				every spare moment during the day and also most evenings. I played most positions well but 
				I had my most success playing in goal and as a defender. In junior school I helped my 
				team win the town championship and finish runner up in the county. If we had won that 
				match we would have been very close to playing in the school boys finals at Wembley 
				stadium in London!
				<p>
				When I was 9 years old my parents took me to a weekly junior pool league. I seemed to 
				have a natural ability for billiards straight away and the passion that I first felt that day as a young boy 
				still burns strongly today. Indeed I would eventually travel around the world and enjoy success
				at local, national and international levels in both 8 ball and more recently 9 ball. Sadly though my athletic 
				ability seems to have degraded exponentially in recent years!
